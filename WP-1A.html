<h2> The Agera RS </h2><hr>
<div>The Agera RS is the ultimate in road and track versatility. It offers
extreme performance and is fully road-legal, complying with safety
standards, emissions and homologation requirements worldwide. It
uses advanced technology developed during our Koenigsegg One:1
program while maintaining all the functionality of previous S and R
models.</div>

<h2> Retaining the best elements </h2><hr>
<div>Practicalities inherited from the Agera R and S programs include a usable 
luggage compartment and a detachable hardtop that can be stowed internally for
top-down motoring at any time.Agera RS enhancements include: advanced lightweight
sound insulation, a front splitter optimized for the track, front winglets, 
skirts, advanced dynamic underbody flap system and a dynamically active rear spoiler 
for added down force (now up to 450 kg at <b>side 250 km/h</b>). The RS also features improved
side air outlets behind the front wheels, increased power and a raised rpm limit.
Even with this added functionality and equipment, the curb weight is lower than the
Agera S and R models, thanks to the use of advanced composites and layup techniques
developed during the One:1 program.The Agera RS included options such as Koenigsegg's
active self-levelling chassis package, 3G connected Pre-Active chassis setups,
alternative aero packages, active sound cancellation and much more.</div>
